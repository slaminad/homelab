# homelab
anything and everything related to my homelab. the eventual goal of this is to migrate everything to kubernetes, but for right now, it is mostly setup through Docker and Ansible.

As of right now, every process is launched through docker-compose up on the target host, but only PiHole is managed through Ansible.
